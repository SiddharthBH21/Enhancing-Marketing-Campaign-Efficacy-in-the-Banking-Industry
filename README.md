# Enhancing Marketing Campaign efficacy in the banking Industry

## Problem Definition
Our goal is to examine the most effective marketing strategies to enhance customer engagement in banks.

To figure out if a bank’s client has opted for a fixed deposit or not.

Further, we aim to examine which marketing strategy is optimal to maximize the customer acquisition rate.

Lastly, we plan to identify the target customer demographic (customer segment most likely to subscribe) for optimal marketing.

## Executive Summary
Call duration was the most important determinant of a marketing campaign’s success at a large Portuguese bank. Success was measured by if a potential customer subscribed to banking services. The optimal call duration of 10-20 minutes led to the highest success rate in the marketing campaign. Calls that were too short or too long proved ineffective. In addition to call duration; education background, job status, loan status, contact type, previous contacts, outcome of previous campaigns, and number of times contacted proved to be important factors in determining a marketing campaign success (see conclusion). Our final recommendations and insights from this analysis are as follows: when focusing on optimizing marketing campaigns, banking institutions should seek to keep call duration around 10-20 minutes and contact customers bi-weekly at most. Banking institutions should take into account previous campaign results and customer level demographics like age, education, loan status, while also monitoring contact type to target specific customer segments. This targeted effort can prove tremendously valuable when seeking to increase bank subscription rate. This can lead to lowered customer acquisition cost (CAC) and reduced expenses for future campaigns. Next steps include analyzing how these results are generalizable to banking institutions & branches across both Portugal and the global market.
